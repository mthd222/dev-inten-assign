# Stage 1: Build the Angular App
FROM node:18-alpine as build
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy source code and build
COPY . .
RUN npm run build --prod

# --- UNIVERSAL FIX: Rename output folder ---
# Finds whatever folder Angular created in 'dist' and renames it to 'build-out'
RUN cd dist && mv "$(ls -A | head -n 1)" build-out

# Stage 2: Serve with Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# --- SPA ROUTING FIX (No external file needed) ---
# We overwrite the default Nginx config directly here to handle "Refresh 404" errors
